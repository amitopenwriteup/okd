In OpenShift, you can interact with DeploymentConfigs using the `oc` command-line tool. Here are some commonly used commands to manage DeploymentConfigs:

1. **Create a DeploymentConfig:**

   To create a new DeploymentConfig, you can use the `oc create deploymentconfig` command. For example:

   
   oc create deploymentconfig my-app --image=my-docker-imagestream:1.14.1
   

2. **Update a DeploymentConfig:**

   You can update a DeploymentConfig's properties, such as the number of replicas or the image version, using the `oc patch` command:

   
   oc patch dc/my-app -p '{"spec":{"replicas":3}}'
   

3. **Scale Up or Down:**

   You can scale the number of replicas up or down using the `oc scale` command:

   
   oc scale dc/my-app --replicas=5
   

4. **Rollout History and Status:**

   To view the rollout history and status of a DeploymentConfig, you can use:

   
   oc rollout history dc/my-app
   oc rollout status dc/my-app
   

5. **Trigger a New Deployment:**

   To trigger a new deployment (rolling update) manually, you can use:

   
   oc rollout latest dc/my-app
   

6. **Pause and Resume Rollouts:**

   You can pause and resume rollouts using the following commands:

   
   oc rollout pause dc/my-app
   oc rollout resume dc/my-app
   

7. **Delete a DeploymentConfig:**

   To delete a DeploymentConfig and associated resources, you can use:

   
   oc delete dc/my-app
   

8. **Exposing Services:**

   After creating a DeploymentConfig, you might want to expose it as a service to make it accessible. You can create a service associated with your DeploymentConfig using the `oc expose` command:

   
   oc expose dc/my-app --port=80
