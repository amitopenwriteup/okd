Here's an example of an egress YAML file in Kubernetes, which defines network policies for outbound traffic from pods:

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-egress
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policy Types:
  - Egress
  egress:
  - to:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
        except:
        - 192.168.1.0/24
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
    - protocol: UDP
      port: 53
  - to:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          project: amitproj
